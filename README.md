```bash
vw run ~/Videos/wallpaper.mov      # start (returns immediately)
vw stop                            # stop
```

## Features

- Plays any local video, looping, on **all screens** or only the main display
- Detached daemon: keeps playing after the terminal closes; `vw run` exits immediately with `Started (PID n)`
- Single-instance lock (`flock`); concurrent starts fail fast with a clear message
- Self-protection: exits on decoder failure, playback stall (8 s by default) or main-thread freeze (6 s by default), instead of showing a frozen desktop forever
- Stable across display sleep/wake, lock/unlock and resolution changes; windows are only rebuilt when the screen configuration actually changes
- English-only CLI output

## Requirements

- Apple Silicon Mac, macOS 26.2+
- Xcode (for `xcodebuild`) — required to build, not needed at runtime

## Install

One line, no clone needed (downloads the latest release):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xingxingmofashu/Wallpaper/main/Scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Or build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xingxingmofashu/Wallpaper.git
cd Wallpaper
./Scripts/install.sh
```

Either way the script installs to the first writable location in this order:
`$VW_PREFIX`, `/usr/local/bin` (sudo only if needed), `/opt/homebrew/bin`, and removes
the previous binary before copying, because overwriting a signed binary in place
(same inode) gets SIGKILLed by macOS on next launch.

Uninstall:

```bash
vw uninstall                                         # using the installed CLI
./Scripts/install.sh --uninstall                    # from a clone
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xingxingmofashu/Wallpaper/main/Scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- --uninstall
```

## Usage

```text
vw run <video> [options]   play video wallpaper in background
vw stop                    stop the running instance
vw uninstall               stop the instance, remove the binary and runtime data
vw version                 show version
vw help                    show full help
```

`vw <video>` (without `run`) also works as a shorthand.

### run options

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--single` | cover only the main display | all screens |
| `--rate <0.1-1.0>` | cap playback rate to lower CPU/GPU load | `1.0` |
| `--stall <seconds>` | auto-exit after playback stalls this long; `0` disables (max 86400) | `8` |
| `--watchdog <seconds>` | auto-exit if the main thread is unresponsive this long; `0` disables (max 86400) | `6` |

Examples:

```bash
vw run ~/Videos/wallpaper.mov --single --rate 0.5
vw run ~/Videos/wallpaper.mov --stall 0 --watchdog 0   # disable auto-exit guards
```

## How it works

- `vw run` re-executes itself via `posix_spawn` with `POSIX_SPAWN_SETSID`: the daemon
  detaches from the terminal (survives close, SIGHUP ignored), stdin goes to `/dev/null`,
  and stdout/stderr append to `~/.vw/vw.log`.
- The daemon writes `~/.vw/vw.pid`; `vw stop` verifies the PID actually belongs to
  `vw` (`proc_pidpath` on both sides) before sending `SIGTERM`.
- A held `flock` on `~/.vw/vw.lock` is inherited by the daemon, so the single-instance
  guarantee covers the whole daemon lifetime and releases automatically on exit or kill.
- One borderless `NSWindow` per screen at the desktop window level with an
  `AVPlayerLayer`; windows are rebuilt only when the screen configuration really changes.

### Runtime files

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `~/.vw/vw.pid` | PID of the running daemon |
| `~/.vw/vw.lock` | single-instance lock |
| `~/.vw/vw.log` | daemon output/errors (truncated at each start) |

## Troubleshooting

- `Another instance is running` → run `vw stop` first.
- Wallpaper gone → the daemon probably exited; check `ps -p "$(cat ~/.vw/vw.pid)"`,
  then start again with `vw run`. The reason for any abnormal exit is in `~/.vw/vw.log`.
- The **lock screen** always shows the system's static wallpaper; that is a macOS
  limitation. The video resumes on the desktop after unlock.
- If you downloaded the binary with a **browser** instead of `curl`, macOS Gatekeeper
  may block it (quarantine); remove the flag with `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine <file>`
  or prefer the curl-based install.

## Development

```bash
xcodebuild -project Wallpaper.xcodeproj -scheme Wallpaper -configuration Debug build
```

Source layout: `Wallpaper/CLI` (command dispatch and subcommands), `Wallpaper/Core`
(playback engine, daemonization, PID/lock files, signal handling).
